``giverny`` is the advanced configuration tool for the Monet Toolchain.

The current subcommands are:

- **help** --- help
- **version** --- outputs version information
- **keys** --- key management tools
- **network** --- configure and build networks
- **transactions** --- generate test transactions sets
- **parse** --- parse a genesis file

***********
Global Flag
***********

The ``--verbose`` flag, or ``-v`` for short, turns on extended messages for
each ``giverny`` command.

****
Help
****

``giverny`` has context sensitive help accessed either by running
``giverny help`` or by adding a ``-h`` parameter to the relevant command.

*******
Version
*******

The ``version`` subcommand outputs the version number for ``monetd``,
``EVM-Lite``, ``Babble`` and ``Geth``.

If you compile your own tools, the suffices are the GIT branch and the GIT
commit hash.

.. include:: _static/includes/giverny_version.txt
    :code: bash

****
Keys
****

The ``keys`` subcommand offers tools to manage keys.

Keys Flags
==========

In addition to the ``--verbose`` flag, the ``keys`` subcommand defines
addtional flags as follows:

.. include:: _static/includes/giverny_keys_flags.txt
    :code: bash

Import
======

The ``import`` subcommand is used to import a pre-existing key pair into the
``monetd`` keystore, assigning the given moniker and setting a passphrase.

.. include:: _static/includes/giverny_help_keys_import.txt
    :code: bash

Generate
========

The ``generate`` subcommand is used to bulk generate key pairs for a test net.
The ``--prefix`` parameter defines a prefix for the account monikers. Then the
``--min-suffix`` and ``--max-suffix`` define the range of accounts names.

E.g. ``--prefix=Acc --min-suffix=1 --max-suffix=3`` would generate accounts:
``Acc1``, ``Acc2`` and ``Acc3``.

.. include:: _static/includes/giverny_help_keys_generate.txt
    :code: bash

*******
Network
*******

The ``network`` command is used to build complex monet networks. The ``new``
command generates the nodes and keys for a network, and automatically calls
the ``build`` command which generates and builds ``genesis.json`` and
``peers.json`` files. You can adjust the network by editting the
``network.toml`` file. The ``location`` command outputs the relevant paths.
The ``push`` command is used to push a giverny network node configuration to a
docker or actual node so it can be used by ``monetd``. ``start``, ``stop`` and
``status`` are used to manage the docker instance.


The *network name* and *node names* must contain only standard letters
(i.e. no accented versions), digits (0--9) or underscores (_).

Location
========

The ``giverny network location`` subcommand takes a single optional parameter
``network_name``. If the network is specified it outputs the location of key
files and folders for that network. If not, only the root giverny configuration
folder is output.

Example without a network name:

.. code:: bash

    $ giverny network location
    /home/user/.giverny

Example with a network specified:

.. code:: bash

    $ giverny network location node7
    Network                 : node7
    Giverny Config Dir      : /home/user/.giverny
    Giverny Networks Dir    : /home/user/.giverny/networks/node7
    Giverny KeyStore Dir    : /home/user/.giverny/networks/node7/keystore
    Peers JSON              : /home/user/.giverny/networks/node7/peers.json
    Genesis JSON            : /home/user/.giverny/networks/node7/genesis.json
    Monetd TOML             : /home/user/.giverny/networks/node7/monetd.toml
    Network TOML            : /home/user/.giverny/networks/node7/network.toml

New
===

The ``new`` subcommand creates a new test network configuration. It also
invokes the build command automatically, unless the ``--no-build`` parameter
is specified.

Syntax
------

.. include:: _static/includes/giverny_help_network_new.txt
    :code: bash

Nodes
-----

The number of nodes in this network is specified by the ``--nodes [int]``
parameter. The ``--initial-peers [int]`` parameter specifies the number of
initial peers. If not set it assumes that all nodes are in the initial peer
set.

IP Addresses
------------

An initial IP address is supplied using the ``--initial-ip`` parameter. It is
assumed the IP address range will be assigned by simply incrementing the last
octet of the IP address for each node. N.B. the first node will be assigned the
actual IP supplied by the ``initial-ip`` parameter.

Node Names
----------

The default node names are a standard prefix of *node* with a unique integer
suffix. You can override the default and supply a list of node names, which are
used in the order supplied, via the ``--names`` parameter.

Node names must contain only standard Latin alphabet characters (ie *a--z* or
*A--Z* with no accents), underscores (_), or digits (*0--9*).

Pass Phrases
------------

There are numerous pass phrase flags for the ``new`` subcommand.

- ``--pass [passfile]`` --- uses the given pass phrase file for all nodes
- ``--generate-pass`` --- generates a unique passphrase for each key pair and
  writes it to a file nodename.txt in the network configuration keystore
  directory
- ``--no-save-pass`` --- suppresses saving pass phrases in the network
  configuration keystore directory

The typical use case scenarios for these flags would be:

- None specified --- you are prompted to enter the passphrase for each node
  which is saved
- ``--pass`` only --- the specified pass phrase is used, and saved in the
  config folder
- ``--pass`` and ``--no-save-pass`` --- the specified pass phrase is used
  **and** not saved in the config folder
- ``--generate-pass`` only --- pass phrases are generated and saved
- ``--no-save-pass`` only --- you are prompted to enter the passphrase for each
  node, which is not saved in the config folder

Build
-----

By default ``giverny network new`` will run ``giverny network build``
automatically. This can be disabled by specifying the ``-no-build`` flag.

Examples
--------

An example of the new subcommand:

.. code:: bash

    $ giverny network new test11 --names e2e/sampledata/names.txt --nodes 7 --pass e2e/sampledata/pwd.txt --initial-peers 3 --initial-ip 192.168.1.19

Build
=====

The ``giverny network build`` subcommand takes a configuration created by the
``new`` subcommand and builds ``peers.json`` and ``genesis.json`` files.

``build`` can be run repeatably safely. It is envisaged that users will edit
the ``network.toml`` file to adjust token allocations or change addresses.

``--no-generate-keys`` disables the creation of any keys not already in the
keystore.

A "built" network will have a file structure like this:

.. code:: bash

    test7
    ├── compile.toml
    ├── contract0.abi
    ├── contract0.sol
    ├── genesis.json
    ├── keystore
    │   ├── Amelia.json
    │   ├── Amelia.txt
    │   ├── Becky.json
    │   ├── Becky.txt
    │   ├── Chloe.json
    │   ├── Chloe.txt
    │   ├── Danu.json
    │   ├── Danu.txt
    ├── monetd.toml
    ├── network.toml
    └── peers.json

List
====

The ``list`` subcommand lists the configured network names.

.. code:: bash

    $ giverny network list
    benchmark
    benchnet
    bulktransfers


Dump
====

The ``dump`` subcommand outputs the nodes in a named network in bar delimited
format as below:

.. code:: bash

    giverny network dump crowdfundnet
    Amelia|172.77.5.10|0x7bBE1Df184142709d5B99C5788982D0bEE5d1167|true|false
    Becky|172.77.5.11|0xC6a29c6378C20eA9E868EdD3538Ba58d09318f81|true|false
    Chloe|172.77.5.12|0x7b225252dEe5aDa558a233c7B8B654Ef366EBe61|true|false
    Danu|172.77.5.13|0xC0d14Ed110045d7A401ecC9E57628D55e56Fd4c4|true|false

Start
=====

The ``start`` subcommand starts a docker network. Individual nodes are not
started unless the ``--start-nodes`` parameter is specified. If the
``--force-network`` parameter is set, then the network is forced down if it
is already running.


.. include:: _static/includes/giverny_help_network_start.txt
    :code: bash

Stop
====

The ``stop`` subcommand stops a docker network and all the nodes within it.

.. include:: _static/includes/giverny_help_network_stop.txt
    :code: bash

Status
======

The ``status`` subcommand shows the docker network status

.. code:: bash

    $ giverny network status

Push
====

The ``push`` subcommand creates a named node on a built docker network. If the
docker network has not yet been build, there is no need to push the node.

.. include:: _static/includes/giverny_help_network_push.txt
    :code: bash

************
Transactions
************

The transaction commands are used to generate transactions sets for end to end
testing of networks.

Generate
========

The ``generate`` subcommand is used to generate transaction sets from the
``network.toml`` file.

The following flags can be set:

.. code:: bash

      --count int        number of tranactions to generate (default 20)
      --faucet string    faucet account moniker (default "Faucet")
  -h, --help             help for generate
      --ips string       ips.dat file path
  -n, --network string   network name
      --surplus int      additional credit to allocate each account from the faucet above the bare minimum (default 1000000)

Solo
====

The ``solo`` subcommand is used to generate transactions sets from a single
funded account. Look in ``e2e/tools/build-trans.sh`` for an end to end example
using the ``solo`` command.

.. include:: _static/includes/giverny_help_transactions_solo.txt
    :code: bash

*****
parse
*****

The ``giverny parse`` command parses a given genesis file to explain the data
stored within it.

.. include:: _static/includes/giverny_parse.txt
    :code: bash

The command checks to see if the contract byte matches the standard version
built into your copy of ``giverny`` -- outputing a warning if not.

It then shows the Smart Contract address and the counts of addresses in the
White List, the Nominee List and the Eviction List.

There is then a data section where each slot has one row of output. The columns
are tab separated, and we would recommend loading the data into a spreadsheet.
The columns are slot, raw data, processed data, description, explained boolean
flag.
