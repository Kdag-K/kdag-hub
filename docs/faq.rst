What is the difference between MONET, MONET Hub, Monet Toolchain and ``monetd``?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``monetd`` is the daemon that runs a node on a blockchain. ``monetd`` is also a
repository on `Github <https://github.com/Kdag-K/kdag-hub>`__. The
repository also hosts ``giverny`` which implements advanced configuration
options.

The Monet Toolchain consists of the ``monetd`` repository, plus additional
software, noticeably `monetcli <https://github.com/mosaicnetworks/monetcli>`__.
Together these repositories provide a complete suite of tools for running a
blockchain. Whilst the Monet Toolchain was initially developed for the MONET
Hub, it has been designed to be easily used by other projects.

The `MONET Hub <https://monet.network/about.html>`__ is a specific blockchain
running on the Monet Toolchain software.

`MONET <https://monet.network/about.html>`__ is the whole ecosystem containing
the MONET Hub, and mobile adhoc blockchains that use the MONET Hub to persist
state.

Why Giverny?
------------

Whilst the name MONET is derived from Mosaic Networks, `Giverny
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giverny>`__ was famously the home of `Claude
Monet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet>`__ and inspiration for many
of his most renowned works.
